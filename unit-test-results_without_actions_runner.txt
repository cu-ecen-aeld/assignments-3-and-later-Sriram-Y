Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.
/home/dev/assignments-3-and-later-Sriram-Y/assignment-autotest/test/assignment4/Test_threading.c:86:test_threading_single_locked_mutex:PASS
Start a thread which waits 250ms before attempting to obtain a mutex, then waits
250ms to release.  Since we aren't locking the mutex in this case, the thread
should not block on mutex_lock()
/home/dev/assignments-3-and-later-Sriram-Y/assignment-autotest/test/assignment4/Test_threading.c:112:test_threading_single_unlocked_mutex:PASS
Setting up thread 1
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.
Setting up thread 2
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.

Verifying thread 2
/home/dev/assignments-3-and-later-Sriram-Y/assignment-autotest/test/assignment4/Test_threading.c:160:test_threading_two_threads_two_mutexes:PASS
Setting up thread 1
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.
Setting up thread 2
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking, using the same mutex as thread 1
Verifying thread 1
Verifying thread 2 (which uses the same mutex as thread 1 and should not require unlock)
